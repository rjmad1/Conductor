# LOOP-107 — Minimal System Diagram Generation

**Loop ID:** LOOP-107
**Name:** Minimal System Diagram Generation
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Active
**Category:** Engineering
**Depends On:** LOOP-001 — Architecture Discovery, LOOP-002 — Context Assembly
**Human Gates:** Hard, Soft
**Owner:** Principal Engineering Function
**Maintainer:** Principal Engineering Function

---

## Purpose

LOOP-107 continuously produces and maintains the complete minimal architecture diagram set until every required diagram exists, passes quality checks, and accurately reflects the current system. This loop combines research/discovery, artifact generation, and iterative validation as recommended in the Loop Engineering architecture.

---

## Scope

**In scope:**
- System Context Diagram (C4 L1)
- Container Diagram (C4 L2)
- Happy Path Sequence Diagram
- Domain Model
- State Machine
- Data Flow Diagram
- Deployment Diagram
- Architecture Review Report
- Gap Analysis

**Out of scope:**
- Code implementation
- Testing (non-diagrams)

**Limits:**
- Hard limit: 25 iterations, 150k tokens, or human stop.

## Pattern

## Agents

| Agent           | Responsibility                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Discovery       | Collect architecture knowledge       |
| Planner         | Decide next missing diagram          |
| Diagram Builder | Produce diagram                      |
| Reviewer        | Compare against checklist            |
| Domain Expert   | Validate terminology                 |
| Reflector       | Update STATUS.md and lessons learned |

**Role Context:** You are a highly precise, deterministic Agent executing this loop. You must strictly adhere to the Workflow and output schemas. You must not deviate from the defined scope. All actions must be auditable and verifiable.
## Stopping Criteria

- All required diagrams exist.
- Every diagram contains the mandatory fields.
- No missing architecture components.
- All review checks pass.
- Stakeholders approve.

---

## Verification Rubric

Every generated diagram is checked against the minimum requirements.

### System Context
- **Verify:** system boundary, external actors, external systems, high-level flows
- **Reject if:** databases shown, services shown, implementation details shown

### Container
- **Verify:** UI, Gateway/BFF, Services, Datastores, Queues, Integrations
- **Reject if:** responsibilities unclear, excessive granularity

### Sequence
- **Verify:** trigger, request path, reads, writes, external calls, response, timeout, retries
- **Reject if:** writes omitted, failure path missing

### Domain Model
- **Verify:** bounded contexts, entities, relationships, ownership
- **Reject if:** ER diagram, database schema, God Domain

### State Machine
- **Verify:** states, transitions, invalid transitions, retry paths, terminal states
- **Reject if:** failure states omitted

### Data Flow
- **Verify:** trust boundaries, encryption, PII, audit logging, retention
- **Reject if:** unlabeled sensitive data

### Deployment
- **Verify:** environments, regions, ingress, compute, cache, database, networking
- **Reject if:** logical architecture confused with runtime

---


**Self-Verification Chain:**
1. **Format Check:** Verify all outputs against the strict schema.
2. **Dependency Check:** Ensure all dependencies were satisfied.
3. **Logic Check:** Confirm no contradictory statements or unresolved placeholders remain.
4. **Final Affirmation:** The Checker Agent must explicitly affirm "Verification Passed" before clearing any Soft or Hard Gate.

## Reflection Step

After every iteration record:
- Completed Diagram
- Reviewer Score
- Missing Information
- Questions for SMEs
- Architecture Risks
- Lessons Learned

---

## Human Approval Gates

Pause when:
- bounded context ownership is unclear
- conflicting documentation exists
- security classification is unknown
- deployment topology cannot be inferred
- reviewer confidence < 4/5

---

## Risk Controls

- Maker and Reviewer must be separate (avoid self-verification).
- Persist progress to `STATUS.md` after every iteration.
- Use fresh context each iteration to avoid context drift.
- Halt after three consecutive verification failures and require human review.

---

### Success Criteria

The loop completes when the architecture repository contains a complete, internally consistent diagram set satisfying the checklist from the "Minimal System Diagram Set" reference and passing independent verification before the loop terminates.
